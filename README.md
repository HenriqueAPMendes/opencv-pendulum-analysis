# OpenCV Pendulum Analysis

Welcome to the OpenCV Pendulum Analysis repository! This project is designed to analyze the motion of a physical pendulum using computer vision techniques with OpenCV. By leveraging the power of OpenCV, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the pendulum's behavior, including tracking, measurement, and visualization.

## Features

- **Pendulum Tracking:** The project uses computer vision algorithms to track the motion of the pendulum. It employs techniques such as contour detection, centroid calculation, and object tracking to precisely monitor the pendulum's position throughout its swing.
- **Motion Analysis:** By analyzing the pendulum's trajectory and motion data, this project enables the calculation of various parameters, such as amplitude, period, and frequency. These measurements provide insights into the pendulum's behavior and dynamics.
- **Visualization:** OpenCV Pendulum Analysis offers visual representations of the pendulum's motion, including real-time tracking, swing trajectory plots, and graphs displaying parameters over time. These visualizations aid in the understanding and analysis of the pendulum's movement.
- **Parameter Adjustment:** Users have the flexibility to adjust various parameters, such as camera calibration, image processing techniques, and analysis settings. This customization allows for fine-tuning the analysis process to different pendulum setups and environmental conditions.
